The Trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a tree-based data structure used primarily for efficient storage and retrieval of strings, particularly useful in scenarios such as autocomplete, spell checking, and prefix-based searches. Each node in the Trie represents a character of a word, and paths from the root to a node correspond to prefixes of stored words. This implementation supports insertion of lowercase English words, searching for exact full words, and checking for existence of words with a given prefix. The design is optimized with dictionaries for child node references to balance speed and memory usage, making it suitable for typical Trie usages in various applications.
