# ðŸ“š CSharp-DSA-PureCode: Data Structures & Algorithms Explained

> A focused collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in C\#. This repository emphasizes **pure, clean code** and **detailed theoretical explanations**, designed for academic study and understanding the underlying logic.

---

## ðŸ“– Introduction and Goal

This repository is dedicated to providing **self-contained, educational** C\# implementations of core computer science concepts.

**Key Focus:**
* **Code Clarity:** Every implementation is written to be as clean and readable as possible.
* **Theoretical Depth:** Each concept is accompanied by a **detailed Markdown file** explaining the logic, time complexity, and space complexity.
* **No Runtime Dependency:** The focus is on the *code itself* and the *algorithms*, making it ideal for review without needing to compile or run.

## âœ¨ Value Proposition

This repository is perfect for:

1.  **Students** learning DSA concepts.
2.  **Developers** reviewing specific algorithms for interviews.
3.  Anyone who wants to see **well-written, standard C\#** solutions to common problems.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Each entry includes the C\# file and a corresponding `README.md` or `.md` file for theory.
